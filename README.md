This program is designed for automated cryptocurrency trading on KuCoin. It monitors price changes, triggering a sell when a specified percentage increase is detected, and performs automatic buys when the price drops below a certain threshold to reduce the cost. The goal is to profit by continuously executing buy and sell operations, optimizing for cost efficiency and gains.
